# Arduino Touch GUI

Recently I purchased an 2.8" TFT-Display with Touch-Panel from Watterott. https://github.com/watterott/mSD-Shield

In order to use the features of a touch screen I developed a library which easily generates touch buttons and touch sliders. To display measurement results I added a tiny chart library.

## Features:

A button can be a simple clickable text or a box with or without text or even an invisible touch area. The autorepeat extension gives 2 thresholds for different autorepeat speeds.

Sliders can have caption and a program controlled value (even text values like high, mid, low are possible)

Chart can have grids, and integer or float axes labels.

The library also contains an example application which is tested for the arduino-UNO.
